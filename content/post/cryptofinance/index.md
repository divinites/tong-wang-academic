## Description
Blockchains and cryptocurrencies represent a novel application of cryptography and information technology to age-old problems such as financial record-keeping, the medium of exchange and decentralised authorities. They may lead to profound changes in the area of banking and corporate governance. Many major players in the financial industry, including regulators and central banks, have started to invest in this new technology. Most blockchain courses in other universities focus on the technique side, i.e., it is usually in the school of computer science or informatics. However, the financial models of cryptocurrencies and ICOs are also critical and might have far-reaching implications on corporate governance structure and the social economy.

This course aims to provide a synthetic overview of cryptocurrencies and blockchain topics related to banking and finance. On the technical side, this course will enable students to understand the essential technical concepts related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies; on the financial side, it aims to equip the student with the capability to identify the underlying business and financial implications of various blockchain projects, and to understand the potential impact on current framework of financial services, corporate governance structure and regulation.
